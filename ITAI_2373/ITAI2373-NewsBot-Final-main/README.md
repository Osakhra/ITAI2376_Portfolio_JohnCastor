# 📰 NewsBot 2.0 — AI-Powered News Intelligence System

## 📌 Overview

NewsBot 2.0 is an **AI-powered, end-to-end news analysis and intelligence platform** I developed as part of my ITAI2373 final project.
It processes, analyzes, and interacts with news articles in real time using advanced **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques.

The system can:

* **Classify** news articles into relevant categories
* **Analyze sentiment** to gauge emotional tone
* **Detect named entities** (people, organizations, locations, dates, etc.)
* **Identify main topics** through topic modeling
* **Summarize** long articles into concise summaries
* **Translate** non-English news into English
* **Answer user questions** via a conversational AI interface (powered by FastAPI + Gradio)

This project was built **module-by-module**, following professional software development practices, with a focus on performance, maintainability, and deployment readiness.

## 🚀 Features

* **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization, language detection
* **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF vectorization for machine learning models
* **News Classification**: Naive Bayes classifier with \~97% accuracy
* **Sentiment Analysis**: Rule-based polarity detection with labeling
* **Named Entity Recognition**: Extracts people, organizations, locations, and dates
* **Topic Modeling**: LDA-based unsupervised topic detection with top keywords
* **Summarization**: Extractive (TextRank) and transformer-based summaries
* **Multilingual Support**: Detect and translate non-English articles
* **Conversational Interface**: Interactive chatbot using a trained intent classifier and query processor
* **Web Deployment**: FastAPI backend with Gradio front-end for real-time user queries

## 📊 Performance

Using the **BBC News dataset**, the Naive Bayes classifier achieved:

```
Accuracy: 96.64%
Precision, Recall, F1-score: ~97% across all categories
```
